This repository is intended to provide several guides and guidelines for BAR development, primarily focused on git and github workflows, but I hope to later expand it to other kinds of documentation and recommendations, like best practices within the code

#### [Git Tutorial](git-tutorial.md)

### [Git Branching Workflow](git-branching-workflow.md)
